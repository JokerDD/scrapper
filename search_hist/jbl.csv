jbl,Thiyagarajan T,5,Simply awesome,"I wanted a good TWS in 5K budget with a working ANC feature. Yes actual ANC feature and not gimmick spec. This is just perfect for me as the audio quality is awesome. But JBL really nailed it with ANC feature as it‚Äôs call quality is amazingly good. I was skeptical a bit as it has just 6mm driver but don‚Äôt think once in your mind once you start using it. JBL Headphones app is working well but would love more presets in there, hope they provide with updates. Overall a really good TWS on budgetüëçREAD MORE"
